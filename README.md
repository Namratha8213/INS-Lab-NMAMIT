# Information and Network Security (INS) Lab

## Overview

This repository contains implementations of various cryptographic techniques and algorithms as part of the **Information and Network Security (INS) Lab**. The programs demonstrate encryption, decryption, key exchange, and secure communication methods. Implementations are written in **Python** and can be executed in **Google Colab or VS Code**.

## Lab Programs

### 1. Implementation of Substitution and Transposition Techniques

Students will implement and analyze the following classical encryption techniques:

#### Substitution Techniques:

- 🔐 **Caesar Cipher**
- 🔐 **Monoalphabetic Cipher**
- 🔐 **Playfair Cipher**
- 🔐 **Hill Cipher**
- 🔐 **Vigenère Cipher**

#### Transposition Technique:

- 🔐 **Rail Fence Cipher**

### 2. Implementation of Cryptographic Algorithms

Explore and implement the following modern cryptographic algorithms:

- 🔑 **Feistel Structure**
- 🔑 **Data Encryption Standard (DES) (Key Generation Only)**
- 🔑 **RSA Algorithm**
- 🔑 **Diffie-Hellman Algorithm**
- 🔑 **Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC)**
